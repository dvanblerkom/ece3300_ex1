# Exercise for ECE3300 Fall 2024

Fix the file src/fsm_example.v to remove the latches.  It must also pass the simulation check.

See the comments in the code src/fsm_example.v

If your code passes the testbench tests, you should see a green check mark on Github at the top
of the repository display.
